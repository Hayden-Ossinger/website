                <h1>Intro</h1>
                <p>I am a Junior that goes to Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. I study Computer Science and
                    Business which works to merge the most prominent aspects of business
                    with the most prominent
                    aspects of computer science. We learn to merge the two fields together to gain insight into the
                    intersection of technology and business - which is only becoming more prominent as business relies
                    on technology more and more.

                <h1>Interests</h1>

                <p>I love to take photos and will bring my film camera and digital camera with me to school each
                    semester. I have a Nikon D7000 that I purchased for quite cheap while in high school. Prior to that
                    I had a Nikon D70,
                    which was gifted to me before I went to Peru (which is below). The film camera is a Minolta SR-T
                    101. While growing up I was surrounded by photography and I was gifted cheaper cameras from a young
                    age and I have
                    been taking photos since. Here is a compilation of some of my favorites from the past few years!
