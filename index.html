                <h1>Intro</h1>
                <p>I am a Junior that goes to Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. I study Computer Science and
                    Business which works to merge the most prominent aspects of business
                    with the most prominent
                    aspects of computer science. We learn to merge the two fields together to gain insight into the
                    intersection of technology and business - which is only becoming more prominent as business relies
                    on technology more and more.
                </p>
